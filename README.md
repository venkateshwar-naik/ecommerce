# E-Commerce
In this project, I developed a comprehensive E-Commerce website featuring a variety of product categories, including mobiles, fridges, air conditioners, furniture, watches, and menswear. The website is designed with robust functionality, allowing users to browse and select products by category.

I implemented essential e-commerce features such as an "Add to Cart" functionality, enabling users to easily add their desired products to their cart. Additionally, a "Remove from Cart" functionality allows users to manage their cart by removing items as needed.

This user-friendly interface ensures a seamless shopping experience, with intuitive navigation through different categories and efficient cart management features.
